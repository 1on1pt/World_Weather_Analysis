# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of the Project
PlanMyTrip is a leading travel technology company that specializes in internet related services in the hotel and lodging industry.  Jack, who is the head of analysis for the user interface team, has asked for my assistance in collecting and presenting data for customers via the search page that can be filtered based on preferred travel criteria to find their ideal hotel anywhere in the world.  Beta testers raved over the PlanMyTrip app, but had made recommendations to add the weather description to the weather data that had been collected.  Beta testers will use input statements to filter the data for weather preferences that will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities and create a travel itinerary.  Ultimately, using the Google Maps Directions API, a travel route between the four cities as well, with a marker layer map, is available for the user.
